### What is this project?
This project is an open source web based ID badge generator software that is meant to be much faster and smoother than most existing paid ID badge solutions due to it being web based.
### What was the inspiraton for this project?
I have had bad experiences with two major ID badge softwares: Datacard ID Centre and HID Asure ID. While using both softwares, I noticed that they would stop responding and lock up for 30 seconds to 2 minutes while performing routine tasks such as switching between badge templates, searching through records (less than 3000) and printing (which takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes to send to the printer after hitting ctrl-p). 
### Why has this project jumped between 3 languages?
Initially this project was started in angular dart due to curiosity about the language. Angular dart ended up overcomplicating this project by forcing us to develop a seperate frontend and backend and connect them and I (memtech3) couldn't seem to understand angular dart past making slight UI changes. The project was then moved to PHP as it was widely used and was easy to grasp. Finally, the project was moved to Python Django as it allowed development to move faster as it took care of most of the things that were holding up development on PHP. I (memtech3) the lead project maintainer have little programming experience and am a student and promise to contribute as much as I can and hope that this project benefits many organizations by creating a much faster, smoother and freer software than most ID badge softwares on the market today.
### How can I learn django so that I can contribute to this project?
This is the django tutorial series that I have been following to help me learn django for this project
