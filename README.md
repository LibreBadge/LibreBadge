## Open source web based ID badge software

## Why has this project jumped between 3 languages?
Initially this project was started in angular dart due to curiosity about the language. Angular dart ended up overcomplicating this project by forcing us to develop a seperate frontend and backend and connect them and I (memtech3) couldn't seem to understand angular dart past making slight UI changes. The project was then moved to PHP as it was widely used and was easy to grasp. Finally, the project was moved to Python Django as it allowed development to move faster as it took care of most of the things that were holding up development on PHP. I (memtech3) the lead project maintainer have little programming experience and am a student and promise to contribute as much as I can and hope that this project benefits many organizations by creating a much faster, smoother and freer software than most ID badge softwares on the market today.
